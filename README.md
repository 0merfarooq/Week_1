Problem Statement: Smart Waste Classification for Sustainable Waste Management
Context

Improper waste segregation is one of the major challenges in achieving environmental sustainability. In many developing regions, waste from households and public areas is not correctly sorted into recyclable, organic, and hazardous categories. This leads to increased landfill accumulation, pollution, and loss of recyclable materials.

Problem

There is a lack of efficient and scalable systems that can automatically identify and classify waste based on its type (plastic, metal, glass, organic, paper, etc.) at the point of disposal. Manual sorting is slow, error-prone, and often unhygienic for waste workers.

Objective

To develop a Deep Learning-based Waste Classification System that can take an image of waste and automatically classify it into categories such as organic, recyclable, and hazardous using image classification models like YOLOv8 or CNNs.

Expected Outcome

A trained AI model capable of accurately identifying different types of waste.

A simple web or mobile interface where users can upload or capture an image of waste.

A system that promotes better waste segregation, supports recycling efforts, and contributes to sustainability goals.
